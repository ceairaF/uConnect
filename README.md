# uConnect


This is a test assignment for uConnect Frontend Developer.



Ticket 1/Task Solution
Change Recipe title tags from h2 to h1. Pretty straightforward, there was only 1 Recipe Title tag that needed to be changed. I changed it, ran npm start, refreshed the WordPress preview to verify that it had changed, then committed the change with a clear message of what I had done.


Ticket 2/Task Solution
Add cooking time. I knew that I only needed to add it to the save.js and not the edit file because the instructions said not to spend time on the editor block. I looked at the code that was already written and basically just copied and pasted it near the bottom to create a new section in the block. I also made sure to add it in the attributes section near the top.


Ticket 3/Task Solution
Calculate Nutriton data with the provided buggy function. I inserted the function as it was, read through all of the lines and started by logging out each section and checking it in the console to really see what we had. I went with a for in loop to loop through the caloriesData. I adjusted the return line so that I could get it as close as I could to the prompt given. 


Ticket 4/Task Solution
Improve the styles and arrangement for a better UX and UI. I first looked at what needed to be fixed within the block and that was the text in the ingredients was being covered up by the words. I created a new div for the Instructions section and gave it display:flex, and padding and the top so that it was underneath the image.
